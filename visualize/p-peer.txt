I thought this group did a good job of clearly explaining their goal and process for their project. I also appreciated the clever title, wonderful examples (especially the Ashton Kutcher one), and the general humor and personality apparent throughout the poster.

I saw this poster and thought to myself, "This is what I have always needed in my life." This group really applied what we're learning in a meaningful and relevant way to our day-to-day lives.

I really liked this poster because the presenters had a working demo of their project, trained on Hamilton lyrics, which was really fun. They also did a good job of displaying the way they worked on it.
